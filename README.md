# My utils
I created this repo just so I don't have to reinvent/recode the wheel the 100th time again... I hope other people will find these useful too.

Also, all this is only provided as-is - all responsibilities are on those using these.

##What's in here?
###PHP stuff
 * unzipit.php: extracts all files from an archive named "g.zip" in the given folder. Useful for quick deploying of CMS systems - no need to wait for all files to be uploaded...
